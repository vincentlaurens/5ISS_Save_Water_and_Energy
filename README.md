## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Nowadays, people are becoming increasingly concerned about the future of our planet. The consequences of climate change are worse every year. Fighting against it has become a source of inspiration for many young entrepreneurs. ILYA is a young startup that is developing two products: a cyclic shower to reduce water consumption and an awareness tool to sensitive people to save water, energy and therefore money when taking a shower. In this report, we present in detail the second product, a tool that allows measuring in real-time the water and energy consumption during a shower. The prototype we developed consists of a sensor system that collects data on the water flow and quantity, stores it in a database, and then display an analysis of this data on a web interface.  The data is captured by an autonomous and energy-efficient node and is then sent via WiFi to a local server to be stored in a database and then on the cloud. The final prototype is not fully optimized but both simple and realistic.

## Device Layer <a name="paragraph3"></a>

expliquer le code esp.

## Network Layer <a name="paragraph4"></a>

1.  Create an account on http://maqiatto.com
   Click on "CREATE ACCOUNT"
   Create your account
2.  After login, clic on your email address on the left top corner
   On the dropdown menu clic on "Broker configuration"
3.  Next page should appear
    ![Maqiatto broker configuration](images/maqiatto.PNG)
    ADD the same topics as shown on the figure (cf First part :Device Layer where you have to replace created topic on the  global code variables)
4. Once differents topics are created you can monitor reception of JSON object by connecting to the http://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/ on a private window in your browser.
    Then you have to fill all the fields as shown in the next figure
    ![hivemq configuration](images/hivemq.PNG)
    Note that vlaurens@etud.insa-toulouse.fr/ilya is the main topic where all data are going to be sent. ( <maqiattoUsername>/ilya ingeneral).

## Application Layer <a name="paragraph5"></a>


expliquer l'application

Go on "ApplicationLayer/data_structure_api" folder and run following command:
````
$ python app.py
````

The API is ready to collect data from broker and store it on mongodb.

## VM <a name="paragraph6"></a>
- Download the VM on the link : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14bD5Wj_I1dPEdrXSYJpSs-G7y7vcGLyr?usp=sharing
- Install VirtualBox and launch the VM.
- Connect to the VM using  ilya/ilya then you have a document which explains every thing on the VM Desktop.
- Go on API folder
```bash 
  $ cd ~/Documents/API/data_structure_api/
  ```
 - Run the API like describe on Application Layer section:
 ````
$ python app.py
````
- Open a browser and enter http://127.0.0.1:1880/ui to show dashboards.
- If you can't access it:
- Run on a Terminal (ctrl+Alt+T) : node-red  command
 ```bash 
  $ node-red
  ```
- Then go on http://127.0.0.1:1880 you will see code of flows and then you can modify them or deploy them.
  You will find flows on 
  ```bash 
  $ cd ~/Documents/API/UI/
  ```
  If you can't show them import the two flows which are on folder "ApplictionLayer/UI" as described on the following tutorial: https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/editor/workspace/import-export.
  If some package are missing install "node-red-contrib-ui" via install menu of nodered.
    - Go on the same menu as import 
    - Choose "manage Palette"
    - Go on install package section
    - Search "node-red-contrib-ui" and install it
    - Exit and close "manage Palette" popup
    - Then Deploy Flow by clicking on "Deploy" Button.
    - Visit http://127.0.0.1:1880/ui
  
  If you want to monitor DataBase you can open a terminal (you can use shortcut ctrl+Alt+T) enter the command : "mongodb-compass&"
- Then open a browser and see the interface. enter 127.0.0.1:27017 and press enter.
  You will see all the databases. The databases are created by the API at the first data reception.

## How to deploy our services on cloud by barely method or using a host OS <a name="paragraph7"></a>

In folder "services" run following command to deploy services
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```
run following command to stop all services
```bash
$ docker-compose down
```

Then open 127.0.0.1:1880 and on the interface
select menu on the top-right corner
In the menu select "manage palette" and in install menu
Install node-red-dashboards

Then select import menu and import two json file which are located in folder ilyaUI directory
